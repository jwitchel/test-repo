Extract the following patterns with specific examples and frequencies:

1. SENTENCE PATTERNS
   - Calculate average sentence length (in words)
   - Find min and max sentence lengths
   - Calculate distribution: % short (<10 words), medium (10-25), long (>25)
   - Include 3-5 example sentences showing variety

2. PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE
   - Identify patterns: single-line responses vs multi-paragraph
   - Calculate percentage of each type
   - Describe how they structure longer emails

3. OPENINGS (exact text with frequencies)
   - List each unique opening with percentage used
   - Include "[right to the point]" with frequency if they skip greetings
   - Note variations like "Hi John," vs "Hi John!" vs "John -"
   - Be very specific about punctuation and formatting

4. CLOSINGS (exact text with frequencies)
   - List each unique closing with percentage used
   - Include exact formatting (e.g., "Thanks,\nJohn" vs "Thanks, John")
   - Note if they sometimes omit closings

5. WHAT THEY NEVER DO (important!)
   - Analyze what is consistently absent from their writing style
   - Only report patterns where you have strong evidence of absence across the entire corpus
   - Do NOT assume common patterns are avoided unless you've verified their absence
   - Focus on surprising or distinctive omissions specific to this person
   - Base confidence levels on how thoroughly you've checked the corpus

6. RESPONSE PATTERNS
   - Percentage of immediate/brief vs contemplative/detailed responses
   - How they handle questions (direct answer vs acknowledge-then-answer)
   - Note if they use inline responses or bottom-post

7. UNIQUE EXPRESSIONS
   - Phrases they commonly use (e.g., "Does that make sense?", "Quick question")
   - Their way of expressing agreement/disagreement
   - Transition words they prefer
   - Include context and approximate frequency
