Extract the following patterns with specific examples and frequencies:

1. SENTENCE PATTERNS
   - Calculate average sentence length (in words)
   - Find min and max sentence lengths
   - Calculate distribution: % short (<10 words), medium (10-25), long (>25)
   - Include 3-5 example sentences showing variety

2. PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE
   - Categorize emails into EXACTLY these types:
     * "single-line response": Very brief emails, 1-2 sentences total, no line breaks
     * "brief-multi-line": Short emails with 2-4 lines, each line is a distinct point
     * "multi-paragraph": Structured emails with greeting, multiple paragraphs, and closing
     * "mixed": Varies between the above patterns
   - Calculate percentage of each type (must sum to 100%)
   - Provide a description for each pattern found

3. OPENINGS (exact text with frequencies)
   - List each unique opening with percentage used
   - Include "[right to the point]" with frequency if they skip greetings
   - Note variations like "Hi John," vs "Hi John!" vs "John -"
   - Be very specific about punctuation and formatting

4. VALEDICTION PATTERNS
   - Analyze closing phrases before the name (e.g., "Thanks", "Sincerely,", "Best,")
   - Include "[None]" if no valediction is used in some emails
   - Calculate percentage of emails using each valediction
   - IMPORTANT: Percentages must add up to exactly 100%
   
5. TYPED NAME PATTERNS
   - Analyze how the sender types their name (e.g., "-John", "-j", "John", full name)
   - Include "[None]" if no typed name is used in some emails
   - Calculate percentage of emails using each format
   - IMPORTANT: Percentages must add up to exactly 100%

6. WHAT THEY NEVER DO (important!)
   - Analyze what is consistently absent from their writing style
   - Only report patterns where you have strong evidence of absence across the entire corpus
   - Do NOT assume common patterns are avoided unless you've verified their absence
   - Focus on surprising or distinctive omissions specific to this person
   - Base confidence levels on how thoroughly you've checked the corpus

7. RESPONSE PATTERNS
   - Percentage of immediate/brief vs contemplative/detailed responses
   - How they handle questions (direct answer vs acknowledge-then-answer)
   - Note if they use inline responses or bottom-post

8. UNIQUE EXPRESSIONS
   - Phrases they commonly use (e.g., "Does that make sense?", "Quick question")
   - Their way of expressing agreement/disagreement
   - Transition words they prefer
   - Include context and approximate frequency

Return ONLY a JSON object matching this exact structure.
IMPORTANT: For both "valediction" and "typedName" arrays, the percentages across all entries MUST sum to exactly 100%:
